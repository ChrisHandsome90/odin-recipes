    <p>You're going to love this short-cut method for preparing a delicious batch of homemade granola! This 10-Minute Peanut Butter Skillet Granola is salty, sweet, crunchy, delicious, and FAST. I don’t have time to worry about baking granola in the oven (and trying not to burn it), so the 10-minute skillet method is the way to go. If you love peanut butter cookies, you’ll love this granola. Try it on top of vanilla Greek yogurt, sprinkle it on top of a smoothie, mix it with trail mix, or grab it by the handful. Believe me -- it disappears fast!</p>
    <p>INGREDIENTS</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil I used avocado oil, but coconut oil, canola oil, or vegetable oil are all fine substitutes</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salted peanut butter</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped unsalted roasted peanuts</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups Old-Fashioned rolled oats</li>
    </ul>
    <p>DIRECTIONS</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil, maple syrup, peanut butter, peanuts, brown sugar, and salt in a large skillet over medium-low heat until completely combined (about 2 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add oats and continue stirring, to coat, for about 5-10 minutes (or until oats are toasted and golden brown).</li>
        <li>Transfer oats to a cookie sheet or large cutting board to cool in a single layer. I like to use the back of a large spoon or spatula to gently press the granola firmly into the cookie sheet. This helps it clump together as it cools and hardens.</li>
    </ol>
