    <p>INGREDIENTS</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hennessy</li>
        <li>Coke-Cola</li>
    </ul>
    <p>DIRECTIONS</p>
    <p>The main thing to know about making Hennessy and Coke: use the right ratio! The standard ratio for a rum and coke is 1 part alcohol to 2 parts cola. But experimenting on this drink, we found that the Hennessy can overpower in that quantity. The best Hennessy and Coke ratio is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Â½ ounces Hennessy to 4 ounces cola</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Of course, if you prefer a stronger drink: be our guest! Increase to 2 ounces Hennessy, or even higher if you like.</p>
